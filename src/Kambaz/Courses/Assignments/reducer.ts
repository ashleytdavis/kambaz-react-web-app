Following Modules/reducer.ts as an example, create an Assignments/reducer.ts

reducer functions such as addAssignment, deleteAssignment, updateAssignment, 
and any other functions as needed. Add the new reducer to the store in 
Kambaz/store/index.ts to add the assignments to the Kambaz application state.
